"This category combines [API3:2019 Excessive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa3-excessive-data-exposure/) and [API6:2019 - Mass Assignment](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa6-mass-assignment/), focusing on the root cause: the lack of or improper authorization validation at the object property level. This leads to information exposure or manipulation by unauthorized parties."
